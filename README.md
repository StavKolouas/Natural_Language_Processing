# Natural_Language_Processing
OVERVIEW
This project demonstrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for semantic text reconstruction and computational analysis.
The goal is to transform unstructured, grammatically incorrect, or semantically ambiguous texts into clear, coherent, and well-structured sentences, while preserving their original meaning.

The project is divided into three main deliverables:

1.TEXT RECONSTRUCTION

Manual reconstruction using a custom CFG automaton built with NLTK

Automated reconstruction using three NLP Python pipelines

Comparison between the methods

2.COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS

Use of BERT embeddings to measure semantic similarity

Cosine similarity computations to compare original versus reconstructed sentences

Visualization of semantic shifts using  t-SNE

3.FULL DOCUMENTATION

Full documentation with methodology, experiments, results, and discussion
